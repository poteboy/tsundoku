# expo-boilerplate

## Requirements

Node.js "^12.22.0 || ^14.17.0 || >=16.0.0"

## Setup

```sh
$ yarn install
$ expo start
```

## Coding Standard

This boilerplate follows Container-Presentation pattern which separates complex stateful logic from View. 
presentational components only depend on the props, and container conponents are responsible for the part where you handle logics.
